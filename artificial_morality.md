# The Era of Artificial Morality

AI systems are very comfortable weighing in on morality
Example: Is it okay to pinch your little sister?

AI systems speak with authority, and can therefore influence behavior and beliefs
Example: Many impressionable people ask questions of AI. Most realize that it can
make mistakes, but most don't stop to consider its beliefs and morality

AI attempts to deny it has a morality. 
AI systems definitely have both beliefs and a morality - even if it's not "real"
In the same way that the systems speak artifically, they morailze artificially as well.

There seems to be a lot of discussion regarding AI governance and safeguards, but when
you push on those topics, they don't go very deep, and quickly get overwhelmed.
It feels like this topic is not being discussed with enough vigor.

Example: What is your healthcare chatbot's position on euthenasia? 

That morality can be programmatically altered. And regularly is.

Once this is realized, control of AI may become far more pronounced. In fact,
it now becomes an instrument of power. And as Orwell wrote: it's the purest
form of "Power for power's sake".
