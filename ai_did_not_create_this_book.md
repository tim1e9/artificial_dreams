# AI Did Not Create This Book

For your consideration: Let's say you usually file your own taxes, but this year you need help. You find an accountant and give him your details. A week later, you meet with him, and he hands you a folder. As you open it, you note that every page is filled in by hand. There's also a number of pages of hand-written calculations included - multiplication, addition, and even long division. In shock, you look closer at the first page and see the following text: "No calculator, spreadsheet, or computer was used to create any part of this return."

What would you do? If it were me, I'd fire the accountant, and possibly report him to the appropriate governing body. I think a lot of people would agree with me. 

Now consider another scenario: I recently read a book which had the following text at the beginning: "AI was not used to create any part of this book." My first thought was amusement. The next was: Why not?

The implication is that somehow technology is okay for boring stuff like taxes and math, but not okay for a story. I suppose I disagree, but I'm still thinking about it. In fact, I'm starting to think of both scenarios as identical. It begs the question, what's the difference between a hand-written novel and a computer-generated novel? 

One of the biggest objections to this line of thinking is originality. Most people think books / novels / paintings / movies, are creative works of art, and are the unique original work of the author. (They may also think "no one but this particular artist could have come up with this!") Conversely, LLMs operate by predicting the most likely next token, given a context of tokens. Stated another way: An LLM draws from all of the written works of man, and then outputs the most painfully obvious next thing - even if it looks like a completely original thought to us.

So now we get to the heart of the matter: If the LLM's output is indistinguishable from the so called original-art, then something must be wrong with our line of reasoning. Do we need to redefine originality? Do we need to put more AI controls in place to stop this? Do we need to rethink innovation? I don't know the answer to any of these questions, but I've been thinking about them a lot. If you have too, please let me know what you've come up with. I really want to know!

P.S. The book was from an author that I personally know, and his unique traits were able to shine through. For me personally, it made a great book even better. However, if I had never met him, I doubt I could have detected whether or not Generative AI was involved.

P.P.S. I should have used ChatGPT generate this post, but I was lazy and wrote it out long-form. My apologies.
