# Artificial Dreams

When it comes to writing about artificial intelligence, I see two extremes. On one side are the “how-to” guides — dense, technical, and hyper-focused on implementation details. They’re useful if you’re looking for a tutorial, but they rarely invite reflection. On the other side are sweeping works of science fiction, the kind Isaac Asimov made famous. He sketched vast futures filled with robots, artificial minds, and moral dilemmas we’re still circling today. And yet, despite the sheer volume of his work, I sometimes feel like no one’s paying much attention. The questions Asimov raised decades ago — about ethics, control, creativity, and what it means to be human — are still with us. But they’re too often drowned out by product announcements, venture capital hype, or the next flashy demo.

What feels missing is a middle ground: thought experiments. A place to pause and ask not just how AI works, but what it means - or what it will mean in the future. That’s what I want Artificial Dreams to be — a space for considering implications, testing ideas, and drawing connections between technology, art, history, and society.

I should also be clear about what this is not. It won’t be a running commentary on current events. The 24-hour news cycle has its place, but I’ve grown weary of it. Very weary. Besides, there are plenty of outlets for that sort of discussion already. Here, I want something different — a quieter place, one step removed from the noise.

As for the writing itself: some essays will be mine, written in long-form, the old-fashioned way. Others will be created with help from generative AI. To ignore that tool would be like an accountant refusing to use a calculator or a spreadsheet — it just doesn’t make sense. But that doesn’t mean the thoughts aren’t my own. If the use of AI bothers you, then perhaps this isn’t the place for you. For me, the point isn’t purity; it’s clarity. AI helps me express ideas more fluidly, and sometimes more sharply, than I might on my own. What matters is the conversation that follows.

And that’s the real reason I’m doing this: conversation. I can read all the technical papers I want, and I can spend hours coding with these new systems, but what I crave is intimacy and community. There’s a deep irony here. Technology has never been better at simulating connection, yet the hunger for real dialogue — messy, imperfect, human dialogue — feels stronger than ever.

This won’t be polished or commercial. No sleek blog, no newsletter subscriptions, no SEO funnels. I’ll be writing on GitHub because that’s where I live as a developer. It’s simple, it’s honest, and it doesn’t need to be anything more.

One more caveat: while I have decades of experience in computer science, I don’t have formal training in the humanities. I haven’t published peer-reviewed work. This isn’t science, it’s not peer-reviewed philosophy, and it’s not authoritative. Think of it instead as a collection of thought experiments — speculative at times, grounded at others, but always exploratory.

At heart, it’s simple: I find discussions about artificial intelligence endlessly fascinating, and I’d like to share them with others who feel the same. If this grows into a community of a handful of thoughtful voices, that’s enough for me. Ten people engaged in genuine dialogue is far more meaningful than ten million scrolling past.

So here it is — Artificial Dreams. An experiment in reflection, conversation, and connection. I don’t know exactly where it will go, but I know it’s worth beginning - at least to me. Consider staying along for the ride.
